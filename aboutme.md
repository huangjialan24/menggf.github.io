title: Computational drug discovery
---

###  Our Goals

Our goal is develop high-throughput methods to find drugs to treat age-depedent complex disease, e.g. Alzheimer's disease. Drug discovery is long-lasting process with high failure. We develop new computational stratergies and methods to falicate drug discovery. 

### Our interests
* New algorithm for network analysis
* Early-stage target discovery
* Alzheimer's disease
